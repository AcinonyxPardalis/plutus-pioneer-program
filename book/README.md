# Plutus Pioneer Program

This folder contains a book based on the PPP lectures from the third cohort:<br>
**Plutus - Learning a smart contract language**

The book has the same structure as the PPP lectures from the 3rd iteration.

In addition the oracle and uniswap examples are also added to book chapters.  
The code for them can be found on the branch **second-iteration**.

If you have any suggestions or improvements you can update the word document in 
the docx folder with tracking changes and sent it to luka.kurnjek@iohk.io.
